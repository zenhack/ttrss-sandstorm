                                        <p id="c979" name="c979">(EDIT: removed the link to Samantha’s post, because the arments and the grubers and the rest of The Deck Clique got what they wanted: a non-proper person driven off the internet lightly capped with a dusting of transphobia along the way, all totally okay because the ends justify the means, and it’s okay when “good” people do it.)</p>
                                        <p id="342d" name="342d">First, I need to say something about this article: the reason I’m writing it infuriates me. Worse than installing CS 3 or Acrobat 7 ever did, and the former inspired comparisons to fecophile porn. I’m actually too mad to cuss. Well, not completely, but in this case, I don’t think the people I’m mad at are worth the creativity I try to put into profanity. This is about a brownfield of hypocrisy and viciously deliberate mischaracterization that “shame” cannot even come close to the shame those behind it should feel.</p>
                                        <p id="2e61" name="2e61">Now, read this post by Samantha Bielefeld: The Elephant in the Room. First, it is a well-written critical piece that raises a few points in a calm, rational, nonconfrontational fashion, exactly the kind of things the pushers of The Great Big Lie say we need more of, as opposed to the screaming that is the norm in such cases.</p>
                                        <p id="cd31" name="cd31">…sorry, I should explain “The Great Big Lie”. There are several, but in this case, our <em>specific</em> instance of “The Great Big Lie” is about criticism. Over and over, you hear from the very people I am not going to be nice to in this that we need “better” criticsm. Instead of rage and anger, volume and vitriol, we need in-depth rational criticism, that isn’t personal or ad hominem. That it should focus on points, not people.</p>
                                        <p id="ae07" name="ae07">That, readers, is “The Big Lie”. It is a lie so big that if one ponders the reality of it, as I am going to, one wonders why anyone would believe it. It is a lie and it is one we should stop telling.</p>

                                        <p id="a02f" name="a02f">Samantha’s points (I assume you read it, for you are smart people who know the importance of such things) are fairly clear:</p>
                                        <ol><li id="9213" name="9213">With the release of Overcast 2.0, a product Samantha actually likes, Marco Arment moved to a <a data-href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">patronage model</a> that will probably be successful for him.</li>
                                            <li id="dfa5" name="dfa5">Arment’s insistence that “<a data-href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" target="_blank">anyone can do this</a>” while technically true, (anyone can in fact, implement this pricing model), also implies that “anyone” can have the kind of success that a developer with Marco’s history, financial status, and deep ties to the Apple News Web is expected to have. This is silly.</li>
                                            <li id="e55d" name="e55d">Marco Arment occupies a fairly unique position in the Apple universe, (gained by hard work and no small talent), and because of that, benefits from a set of privileges that a new developer or even one that has been around for a long time, but isn’t, well, <em>Marco</em>, not only don’t have, but have little chance of attaining anytime soon.</li>
                                            <li id="35fb" name="35fb">Marco has earned his success and is entitled to the benefits and privileges it brings, but he seems rather blind to all of that, and seems to still imagine himself as “two guys in a garage”. This is just not correct.</li>
                                            <li id="38e2" name="38e2">In addition, the benefits and privileges of the above ensure that by releasing Overcast 2 as a free app, with patronage pricing, he has, if not gutted, severely hurt the ability of folks actually selling their apps for an up-front price of not free to continue doing so. This has the effect of accelerating the “race to the bottom” in the podcast listening app segment, which hurts devs who cannot afford to work on a “I don’t really need this money, so whatever you feel like sending is okay” model.</li>
                                        </ol><p id="0481" name="0481">None of this is incorrect. None of this is an ad hominem attack in any way. It is just pointing out that a developer of Arment’s stature and status lives in a very different world than someone in East Frog Balls, Arkansas trying to make a living off of App sales. Our dev in EFB doesn’t have the main sites on the Apple web falling all over themselves to review their app the way that Arment does. They’re not friends with the people being The Loop, Daring Fireball, SixColors, iMore, The Mac Observer, etc., yadda.</p>
                                        <p id="5a45" name="5a45">So, our hero, in a fit of well-meaning ignorance writes this piece (posted this morning, 14 Oct. 15) and of course, the response and any criticisms are just as reasonable and thoughtful.</p>
                                        <p id="3bc7" name="3bc7">If you really believe that, you are the most preciously ignorant person in the world, and can I have your seriously charmed life.</p>

                                        <p id="b151" name="b151">Thank you for restating something in the article. To the person who wrote it.</p>
                                        <p id="87bc" name="87bc">In the original article, Samantha talked about the money Marco makes from his podcast. She based that on the numbers <a data-href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">provided by ATP in terms of sponsorship rates</a> and the number of current sponsors the podcast has. Is this going to yield perfect numbers? No. But the numbers you get from it will at least be reasonable, or should be unless the published sponsorship rates are just fantasy, and you’re stupid for taking them seriously.</p>
                                        <p id="dbda" name="dbda">At first, she went with a simple formula:</p>
                                        <blockquote id="1b4e" name="1b4e">$4K x 3 per episode = $12K x 52 weeks / 3 hosts splitting it.</blockquote>
                                        <p id="0b33" name="0b33">That’s not someone making shit up, right? Rather quickly, someone pointed out that she’d made an error in how she calculated it:</p>
                                        <blockquote id="76d7" name="76d7">That’s $4k per ad, no? So more like $12–16k per episode.</blockquote>
                                        <p id="a089" name="a089">She’d already realized her mistake and fixed it.</p>
                                        <blockquote id="b369" name="b369">which is actually wrong, and I’m correcting now. $4,000 per sponsor, per episode! So, $210,000 per year.</blockquote>
                                        <p id="8b3b" name="8b3b">Again, this is based on <em>publicly available data</em> the only kind someone not part of ATP or a close friend of Arment has access to. So while her numbers may be wrong, if they are, there’s no way for her to know that. She’s basing her opinion on actual available data. Which is sadly rare.</p>
                                        <p id="135a" name="135a">This becomes a huge flashpoint. You name a reason to attack her over this, people do. No really. For example, she’s not calculating his <em>income taxes correctly</em>:</p>
                                        <blockquote id="5e7e" name="5e7e">especially since it isn’t his only source of income thus, not an indicator of his marginal inc. tax bracket.</blockquote>
                                        <blockquote id="6036" name="6036">thus, guessing net income is more haphazard than stating approx. gross income.</blockquote>
                                        <p id="aac1" name="aac1">Ye Gods. She’s not doing his taxes for him, her point is invalid?</p>
                                        <p id="600f" name="600f">Then there’s the people who seem to have not read anything past what other people are telling them:</p>
                                        <blockquote id="9b62" name="9b62">Not sure what to make of your Marco piece, to be honest. You mention his fame, whatever, but what’s the main idea here?</blockquote>
                                        <p id="c18a" name="c18a">Just how spoon-fed do you have to be? Have you no teeth?</p>
                                        <p id="c445" name="c445">Of course, Marco jumps in, and predictably, he’s snippy:</p>

                                        <p id="8f8d" name="8f8d">If you’re going to be like that, it’s best to provide better data. Don’t get snippy when someone is going off the only data available, and is clearly open to revising based on better data.</p>
                                        <p id="cc97" name="cc97">Then Marco’s friends/fans get into it:</p>

I watched Fleishman berate a friend of mine who has been an engineer for…heck, waaaaay too long on major software products in the most condescending way because she tried to point out that as a <em>very</em> technical woman, “The Magazine” literally had nothing to say to her and maybe he should fix that. “Impertinent” was I believe what he called her, but I may have the specific word wrong. Not the attitude mind you. Great Feminists like Glenn do not like uppity women criticizing Great Feminists who are their Great Allies.</p>

In spite of his loud declarations of support for The Big Lie, Marco Arment is as bad at any form of criticism that he hasn’t already approved as a very insecure tween. An example from 2011: <a data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9</a></p>
                                        <p id="ba3c" name="ba3c">Marco is great with criticism as long as it never actually criticizes him. If it does, be prepared a flood of petty, petulant whining that a room full of bored preschoolers on a hot day would be hard-pressed to match.</p>
                                        <p id="a5a0" name="a5a0">Today has been…well, it sucks. It sucks because someone doing what all the Arments of the world claim to want was naive enough to believe what they were told, and found out the hard way just how big a lie The Big Lie is, and how vicious people are when you’re silly enough to believe anything they say about criticism.</p>
                                        <p id="2a25" name="2a25">And note again, every single condescending crack, misrepresentation, and strawman had an exclusively male source. Most of them have, at one point or another, loudly trumpted themselves as Feminist Allies, as a friend to women struggling with the sexism and misogyny in tech. Congratulations y’all on being just as bad as the people you claim to oppose.</p>
                                        <p id="a47a" name="a47a">Samantha has handled this better than anyone else could have. My respect for her as a person and a writer is off the charts. If she choses to walk away from blogging in the Apple space, <em>believe me</em> I understand. As bad as today was for her, I’ve seen worse. Much worse.</p>
                                        <p id="aa8e" name="aa8e">But I hope she doesn’t. I hope she stays, because she is Doing This Right, and in a corner of the internet that has become naught but an endless circle jerk, a cliquish collection, a churlish, childish cohort interested not in writing or the truth, but in making sure The Right People are elevated, and The Others put down, she is someone worth reading and listening to. The number people who owe her apologies goes around the block, and I don’t think she’ll ever see a one. I’m sure as heck not apologizing for them, I’ll not make their lives easier in the least.</p>
                                        <p id="34c5" name="34c5">All of you, all. of. you…Marco, Breen, Snell, Vittici, had a chance to live by your words. You were faced with reasoned, polite, respectful criticism and instead of what you should have done, you all dropped trou and sprayed an epic diarrheal discharge all over someone who had done nothing to deserve it. Me, I earned most of my aggro, Samantha did not earn any of the idiocy I’ve seen today. I hope you’re all proud of yourselves. Someone should be, it won’t be me. Ever.</p>
                                        <p id="9710" name="9710">So I hope she stays, but if she goes, I understand. For what it’s worth, I don’t think she’s wrong either way.</p>
